# Sponsors List Web App

This is a simple web application for tracking and displaying sponsorships for online personalities. It allows users to submit sponsor information via a form, which is then uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. The app also retrieves and displays all sponsor entries from the same S3 bucket in a table format.

## Features
- Add new sponsor entries with details such as personality, sponsor name, platform, code/link, post, start date, and status fields.
- All data is stored and retrieved from AWS S3 using browser-side JavaScript and AWS Cognito for authentication.
- Supports dark mode toggle for user interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AWS S3 (for storage)
- AWS Cognito (for authentication)
- jQuery (for DOM manipulation)
