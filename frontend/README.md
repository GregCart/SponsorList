The app also retrieves and displays all sponsor entries from the same S3 bucket in a table format.

## Features
- Add new sponsor entries with details such as personality, sponsor name, platform, code/link, post, start date, and status fields.
- All data is stored and retrieved from AWS S3 using browser-side JavaScript and AWS Cognito for authentication.
- Supports dark mode toggle for user interface.

- AWS S3 (for storage)
